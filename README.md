SAFAS is the 'self-aware functional assembler'

In this case 'self-aware' refers to its design: SAFAS does not target any specific
architecture: it's possible to write definition files to generate assembly code for
any architecture (and/or mix up multiple architectures if needed)

'Functional' refers to how its macro language works. Programs written in SAFAS look
a lot like LISP.
